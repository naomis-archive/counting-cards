    <h1>Counting Cards - Intermediate</h1>
    <p>
      For this difficulty level, you will be given a set of five cards, but only
      one at a time. Each card will be visible for only one second - then the
      next card will appear. At the end of the sequence, make your guess for the
      current count value!
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      Click the deal button to deal 5 cards. The computer will begin the
      card-counting method and deal the sequence of cards. After each sequence,
      you can enter your guess for the current count in the box, and click
      "Check count". The computer will let you know if you are correct. Click
      the "Reset" button to reset the count.
