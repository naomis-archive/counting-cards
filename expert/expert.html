    <h1>Counting Cards - Expert</h1>
    <p>
      For this difficulty level, you will play some actual Blackjack! Your goal
      is to keep count of the cards while also playing the game.
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      Click the deal button to deal a hand of cards. You'll receive your two
      cards, face up, and the dealer will receive their two cards (one will be
      hidden). Your goal is to get as close as possible to 21 without going
      over. You may "hit", to take another card, or "stand", to end your turn
      and let the dealer play. The dealer will hit if its total is less than 17,
      otherwise the dealer will stand. For simplicity sake, special rules are
      not applied - you will not have the option to split, double down, and the
      dealer will not automatically win on a natural 21. Aces will always be
      valued at 11.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any time, you can enter a guess for the current count value, and click
      the "Guess the Count!" button to validate your guess. Click "Reset" to
      start the game over.
