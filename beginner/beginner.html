    <h1>Counting Cards - Beginner</h1>
    <p>
      For this difficulty level, you will be given a set of five cards at once.
      You should attempt to keep track of the count, and submit your guess for
      the current count value after each set of cards is dealt.
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      Click the deal button to deal 5 cards. The computer will begin the
      card-counting method. You can click the deal button again to deal another
      5 cards (but your current 5 will be discarded). At any time, you can enter
      your guess for the current count in the box, and click "Check count". The
      computer will let you know if you are correct. Click the "Reset" button to
      reset the count.
