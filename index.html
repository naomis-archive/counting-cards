    <h1>Counting Cards</h1>
    <p>
      Counting Cards is a method used to predict the likelihood of being dealt
      high-value cards in Blackjack and adjusting your bet accordingly (to
      increase the chances of winning). When low cards are dealt, the count
      increases. When high cards are dealt, the count decreases. If the count is
      high, you should bet higher. If the count is low, you should bet lower.
