    <h1>Counting Cards</h1>
    <p>
      Counting Cards is a method used to predict the likelihood of being dealt
      high-value cards in Blackjack and adjusting your bet accordingly (to
      increase the chances of winning). When low cards are dealt, the count
      increases. When high cards are dealt, the count decreases. If the count is
      high, you should bet higher. If the count is low, you should bet lower.
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      Click the deal button to deal 5 cards. The computer will begin the
      card-counting method. You can click the deal button again to deal another
      5 cards (but your current 5 will be discarded). At any time, you can enter
      your guess for the current count in the box, and click "Check count". The
      computer will let you know if you are correct. Click the "Reset" button to
      reset the count.
